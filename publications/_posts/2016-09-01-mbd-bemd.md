summary: Retinal eye fundus images are used for diagnostic pur- poses, but despite controlled conditions in acquisition they often suffer from uneven illumination and blur. In this work, we propose the use of multi-channel blind deconvolution for the restoration of blurred retinal images. The estimation of an adequate point-spread function (PSF) is highly depen- dent on the registration of at least two images from the same retina, which undergo illumination compensation. We use the bi-dimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) approach to model the illumination distribution as a sum of non-stationary signals. The BEMD approach enables an artifact-free compensation of the illumination in order to estimate an adequate PSF and carry out the best restoration possible. Encouraging experimental results show signifi- cant enhancement in the retinal images with increased con- trast and visibility of subtle details like small blood vessels.
