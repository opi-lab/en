summary: In Fourier Transform Profilometry, a filtering procedure is performed to separate the desired information (first order spectrum) from other unwanted contributions such as the background component (zero-order spectrum). However, if the zero-order spectrum and the high order spectra compo- nent interfere the fundamental spectra, the 3D reconstruc- tion precision decreases. In this paper, we test two recently proposed methods for removing the background intensity so as to improve Fourier Transform Profilometry reconstruc- tion precision. The first method is based on the twice piece- wise Hilbert transform. The second is based on Bidimen- sional Empirical Mode Decomposition, but the decompo- sition is carried out by morphological operations In this work, we present as a novel contribution, the sequential combination of these two methods for removing the back- ground intensity and other unwanted frequencies close to the first order spectrum, thus obtaining the 3D topography of the object. Encouraging experimental results show the advantage of the proposed method.
