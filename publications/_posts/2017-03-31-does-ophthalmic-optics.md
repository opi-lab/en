summary: This paper presents results of the research related with the development of the doctoral thesis of Lenny Alexandra Romero Pérez. This work covers the design, the characterization and the analysis of several programmable diffractive optical elements (PDOEs) such as: Fresnel lenses, multifocal lenses, integrated combinations of phase-masks with lenses, and DOEs with extended depth of focus (EDOF) like the Light Sword optical element and the Peacock Eye. This has been pursued to address several problems of human vision, like myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia, by means of the implementation of such DOEs on a Holoeye Liquid Crystal on Silicon HEO 1080P spatial light modulator. We have developed and implemented several algorithms for generating the necessary optical elements to compensate the different ametropies. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that several of the considered DOEs have the sufficient imaging performance and thus the potential for compensating ametropies and presbyopia.
